This project tackled distribution challenges in general trade due to the division of a sales area into three regions. I reorganized the regions by clustering large customer bases, assigning them to the nearest centroids, and balancing salesman workloads. The optimized scheduling of visits resolved overlaps and disputes, though there was room for further improvement.
